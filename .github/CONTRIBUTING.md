# Contributing to DictationApp

Thanks for your interest in contributing. DictationApp is an open-source,
privacy-first voice-to-text app, and improvements from the community —
bug reports, fixes, docs, features — are very welcome.

The canonical contributing guide lives at
**[docs.openwhispr.com/contributing](https://docs.openwhispr.com/contributing)**.
This file is a short pointer with the repo-local details you may need
along the way.

## Filing issues

- Bugs and feature requests:
  [github.com/OpenWhispr/openwhispr/issues](https://github.com/OpenWhispr/openwhispr/issues)
- Please use the existing issue templates (`bug_report`, `feature_request`)
  so we have the info needed to reproduce.
- For transcription or audio problems, attaching debug logs is a huge
  help — see [`DEBUG.md`](../DEBUG.md) for how to enable debug logging
  and where the log files live, and [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
  for common fixes to try first.

## Reporting security issues

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**
Follow the process in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md): use
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/OpenWhispr/openwhispr/security/advisories/new)
or email `security@openwhispr.com`.

## Contributing code

See the [contributing guide](https://docs.openwhispr.com/contributing)
for the full workflow, coding conventions, and review expectations.
The short version:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main`.
2. Make your change, keeping the diff focused.
3. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request against `OpenWhispr/openwhispr` `main` and fill
   in the description so reviewers can see the "why".
